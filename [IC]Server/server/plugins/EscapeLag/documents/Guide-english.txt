Welcome to the configuration guide!
First of all, thank you for using the EscapeLag plugin.
The plugin is a technically optimized plug-in that integrates optimization, fixes vulnerabilities, limits actions, and is highly efficient.

Check out this guide to configure your Config.yml file correctly.
If you have questions or bug feedback during configuration or use, please contact QQ 1207223090 for assistance.

It should be noted that this plugin may be restarted once for the first time in the server.
This is not a plugin that causes the server to crash, but rather a value that the plugin restarts to apply the plugin to save.

I wish you a happy time~

1. Prepare the server
This plugin is different from other plugins, which will automatically match the server code to generate the configuration.
Don't worry about garbled issues, your editors should follow the configuration coding rules.
In order to auto-restart the server, set up an automatic restart script for your own server.
If your server is a web panel manipulation server, don't worry about this.
If your server is a VPS, add a self-restart script to the server-side script.
If you don't include a self-starting script, please refer to the post: http://www.relatev.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=128
Tip: If your prompt information option has "" or '' (left blank but needs to keep quotes), it means you have turned off this prompt.
